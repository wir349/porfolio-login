<h2><b>Sample Login App</b></h2>
Functionality-wise I've tried to keep this as simple as possible so I can focus on the architecture of the app which I really want to show-case.

If you want to see a swift-version of this, click here. Right now it's more and less simply a copy but I plan to diverge the two projects eventually.


<u>Functionality</u>

In terms of functionality this app is REALLY simple. All it does is mimick a login functionality <b>W/O</b> a real api. No matter which email/password combination you put it'll allow you to login
